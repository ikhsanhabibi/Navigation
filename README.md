React Native (Navigation, Barcode Scanner)


# WARNING
This project was built in expo, that means ios and android folder should not be touched. But, I am still learning react native and confusing so just follow this rules below.

- npm install
- expo eject
- to run app in iOS ("cd ios", then "pod install") | go back "cd .."| npm run ios
- to run app in android | npm run android
